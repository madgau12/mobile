        <P>Belugas are a sociable bunch, often gathering in large numbers, and most of them are chatty as well. 
            Their vocalizations, which include whistles, clicks, and grunts, earned them the nickname “sea canary.” 
            In the summer, different groups of belugas will come together in the relatively warm waters of estuaries 
            and the nearby coastal waters. Beluga mothers seem to find the quiet estuaries ideal for raising their 
            newborns or yearlings—but it’s also a good environment for the belugas to molt. They have extremely thick 
            skin that they shed all at once each summer, often rubbing on the bottom of the estuary to speed the process 
            along. New skin cells grow rapidly.</P>
        
        <p>Once commercially hunted, the much-admired beluga is now a star attraction in the growing ecotourism industry. 
            It‘s also a poster child for ocean conservation. As a top predator, it’s being contaminated by toxic chemicals 
            that are concentrated high in the food chain.</p>
