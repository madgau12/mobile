            <p>Length: 50 to 60 feet
            <br>Lifespan: about 100 to 200 years
            <br>Classification: Baleen
            <br>Distinguishing Feature(s): strong, triangular skull

        <P>Bowhead whales are second only in size to blue whales. 
            They also have the longest baleen of any whale—the plates reach 5m in length! 
            Living year-round in the Arctic, bowhead whales are predominantly black with the 
            exception of grey/white patches on the front of the lower jaw, and sometimes on the 
            narrow base of the tail. As well as lacking a dorsal fin, bowhead whales have a 
            distinctive double-humped surface profile, an enormous arched upper jaw, and a strongly 
            bowed mouth-line (hence the name).</P>
        
        <p>Bowhead whales are associated with ice floes, which means their movement patterns are
             influenced by the melting and freezing of ice. Their blubber is half a metre thick, 
             which is the thickest found on any mammal. Based on findings from the recovery of 
             stone harpoon heads and the analysis of eye tissue, scientists believe that the bowhead 
             whale may be the longest-living animal in the world—it is possible they can live for more 
             than 100 years — perhaps even up to 200 years.</p>
